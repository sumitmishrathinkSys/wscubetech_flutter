// What is Flutter?
// A tool that allows you to build native cross-platform (Android , IoS, Web, Deskstop)
// applications with one programming language and cosebase

// Cross Platform is also known as multiplatform or platform independent.

// Native vs CrossPlatform vs Hybrid

// Native : An application developed exclusively 
// for a single platform using a native-to-the-operating-system language is a Native App.

// Hybrid :
// A blend solution that consists of both native and web solutions. 
// Developers embed the code written with web development languages (HTML, CSS and JS) 
// into a native app using plugins like Apache Cordova or Ionic's Capacitor.

// Cross Platform :
// Write code once and reuse for different platforms.


// What is flutter?
// Flutter is a cross-platform mobile application development framework.

// Why flutter?
// It greatly increases development speed while reducing costs - 
// two of the most important factors when creating any app.
// In addition, it's built-in widgets allow developers
// to quickly build custom user interfaces without writing complex 
//codes from scratch or manually adjusting for different platforms.


// Benefits of Flutter?
// 1. Same UI and Business Logics in all platforms 
// 2. Reduced Code Development Time
// 3. Increased Time-to-market speed 
// 4. Similar to Native App Performance
// 5. Custom, Animated UI of any complexity available
// 6. Own Rendering Engine
// 7. Simple Platform Specific Logic Implementation
// 8. The Potential ability to go beyond mobile
// 9. Large Community Support
// 10. Continous sdk updates in flutter
// 11. Provide AOT(A Head of Time) and JIT (Just in time) features


// How it is better than it's counterparts? How it is better than others?
// For ex: - 
// In react native when we used RaisedButton so when this run on ios then ios called its native button UI Button so here it is creating a bridge that's why some time is taken in this process and same for android android called it's native button Widget.Button.
// But in flutter when we used RaisedButton so "It directly controls every pixel which is drawn" (Custom Implementation)
// So here it is not creating any bridge so it is fast and efficient.

// In React Native there are two main components 
// 1. Platform :- By which user can interact with the app like  Canvas and Events -> OEM Widgets
// 2. Services :- (Location, Bluetooth, Audio, Sensors, Camera, etc.)
//  so for use Services on user interaction bridges are created 


// In flutter there are also two main components 
// 1. Platform :- By which user can interact with the app like  Canvas and Events -> Widgets Rendering
// 2. Services :- (Location, Bluetooth, Audio, Sensors, Camera, etc.) -> Platform Channels
//  so for use Services on user interaction Platform Channels are used (No bridges are required)

// In flutter everything is Widgets
// It's all about
